Introduction :
	--> CRoPS : Combined Roadmaps and Potentials for 
		Swarms.
	--> Our approach combines probabilistic roadmaps 
		and potential fields to guide a swarm through
		an environment
	--> Potential fields provide the robots with an
		efficient local planner
	--> Roadmaps provide the swarm with the ability 
		to maneuver through a complex environment
	--> To escape the local minima, random walks in 
		combination with adjustments to the potential
		fields are used.
	--> Experimental results show promising validation 
		on the efficiency and scalability of the proposed
		approach.

Motiviation : 
	--> Swarm robotics seeks to enable a large swarm of 
		robots to accomplish complex tasks with simple 
		interactions
	--> Research interests in scalable approaches of swarm
		robotics include exploration, mapping, monitoring,
		inspection and search and rescue missions. 
	--> Artificial potential fields are scalable but in
		real world applications with complex environments
		often are unable to find a solution and are likely
		to get stuck in the local minima
	--> Probabilistic roadmaps work well for complex 
		environments but suffer from lack of 
		scalability and require considerable
		precomputation. Also, as the number of robots
		increases, it becomes difficult to sample 
		collision free configurations.
	--> PRMs also do not promote fluidity in movment such 
		as a swarm would need.

CRoPS Intro :
	--> A highly scalable approach in which the roadmap is
		constructed over the 2-D work space and uses APFs
		to enable the swarm to move in cohesion from one 
		intermediate goal to another avoiding collisions.

Method : 
	--> Swarm is governed by 4 principles,
		1. There is long range attraction to intermediate 
		   goals
		2. Robots are repulsed by obstacles
		3. Robots are repulsed from other robots
		4. Robots' headings are influenced by the 
		   headings of their neighbours
