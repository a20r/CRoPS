*** Title slide
add location to universities, i.e., Washington, DC, USA for CUA

*** Related Works
remove this slide

*** Potential Fields
change title to Path Planning for Swarms via Potential Fields


*** Potential Fields Shortcomings
change title to Limitations of Path Planning via Potential Fields
change "For sufficiently large environments..." to
"Potential fields often lead robots into local minima especially when dealing
with complex environments and large swarms"


*** Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs)
change title to Path Planning for Swarms via Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs)
move figure a bit down so that you see the word "connectivity" -- as it is, it
cuts off the "y" and makes it read as "v"

*** PRM Shortcomings
change title to Limitations of Path Planning via PRMs


*** Our Approach
change title to Proposed Approach
change "Combined roadmaps and ..." to
"Combine roadmaps and potentials for swarms (CRoPS) to enable fast path planning for swarms"

remove "We present an..." as it is already covered in the first bullet point

change "Probabilistic roadmaps provide..." to
"Probabilistic roadmaps provide high-level guidance of how swarm should move towards the goal"


*** Swarm Motion
remove periods at the end of sentences

*** Add a new slide titled "CRoPS: Combined Roadmaps and Potential Fields"
 o Construct roadmap using PRM
 o Search roadmap to compute intermediate goals for each boid
 o Repeat until solved
 o    assign next goal to boids that have reached current goal
 o    compute overall potential for each boid
 o    compute new heading based on overall potential
 o    update positions

*** Roadmap Construction
ok

*** Roadmap Weights
change "In order to bias..." to
"In order to bias the swarm towards less cluttered areas, nodes further away from obstacles are assigned higher weights"

change "The weight of the edge...." to
"Edge costs reflect not only the distance among the endpoints, but also their clearance away from obstacles, i.e.,"

change "w(qi, qj)" to "cost(qi, qj)"


*** Shortest Path
change title to "Guiding the Swarm through the Shortest Roadmap Path"
remove period from end of sentence

change the bullet points as follows:

o Shortest roadmap path serves as high-level guide
o Computed using Dijkstra's algorithm
o Guide provides a series of intermediate goals defined as circles centered at the path vertices
o CRoPS seeks to move the swarm to the final destination by passing each bot through these intermediate goals

*** Potential Fields and all the slides afterwards
ok
